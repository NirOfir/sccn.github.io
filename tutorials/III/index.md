The EEGLAB Tutorial is split into four parts. The third part is the
Advanced Topics. In the Advanced Topics, the user is introduced to more
advanced elements of EEGLAB such as script writing and artifact
rejection. These topics are recommended for the user to successfully
master EEGLAB. These sections are not as step by step as the single
subject or multiple subject processing tutorials and should be used as a
reference and not a manual. As of { {REVISIONMONTH} }/{ {REVISIONDAY}
}/{ {REVISIONYEAR} }, there are three topics in the Advanced Topics.
