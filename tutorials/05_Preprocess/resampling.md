Changing the data sampling rate
======

Load the sample EEGLAB dataset
---------------------------------

Select menu item <span style="color: brown">File</span> and press sub-menu item
<span style="color: brown">Load existing dataset</span>. Select the tutorial file "eeglab_data.set" distributed with
the toolbox and located in the "sample_data" folder of EEGLAB. Then press *Open*.

Change the sampling rate
---------------------------------

The most common use for <span style="color: brown">Tools â†’ Change sampling
rate</span> is to reduce the sampling rate to save memory and disk
storage. A [pop_resample.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_resample.m) window pops up, asking for the new
sampling rate. The function uses Matlab *resample()* (in the Signal
Processing toolbox-- if you do not have this toolbox, it will use the
slow Matlab function *griddata*).

You do not need to change the sampling rate for processing the tutorial data since it is already at an acceptable sampling rate.

Before resampling, a low-pass filter at half the resampling frequency (so 64 Hz if you resample at 128 Hz) is applied to the data to avoid aliasing effects.
