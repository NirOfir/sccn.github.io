The EEGLAB Tutorial is split into three parts. The first part is the
Main Tutorial. In the Main Tutorial, a user is led through how to set up
EEGLAB on their computer and is introduced to basic EEGLAB functions.
The user is instructed through a series of Key and Exploratory Steps to
manipulate a sample data set (provided). This basic tutorial should
enable to user to develop a good understanding of how to use EEGLAB for
their own experiments. As of { {REVISIONMONTH} }/{ {REVISIONDAY} }/{
{REVISIONYEAR} }, there are twelve topics in the Main Tutorial.

Below are 6 short presentations for an introduction to EEG signal
processing and EEGLAB. Click on the image below to access the
