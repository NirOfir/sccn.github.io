The EEGLAB Tutorial is split into four parts, the last of which is the
Appendices. In the Appendices, the user is introduced to more advanced
and technical elements of EEGLAB such as input data formats and Matlab
data structures. These topics are presented to the user to fully
describe the architecture, etc. of the EEGLAB system. These sections are
a reference only; more information can be found by contacting the
appropriate SCCN personnel. As of { {REVISIONMONTH} }/{ {REVISIONDAY}
