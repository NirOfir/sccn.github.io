Finding ERP peak latencies
--------------------------------

Although EEGLAB currently does not have tools for automatically finding
ERP peak amplitudes and latencies, one can use the convenient Matlab
zoom facility to visually determine the exact amplitude and latency of a
peak in any Matlab figure.

For example, in the figure above select the magnifying-glass icon having the **+** sign. Then, zoom in on the main peak of the red curve as shown below (click on the left mouse button to zoom in and on the right button to zoom out). Read the peak latency and amplitude to any desired precision from the axis scale.

EEGLAB extensions
---------------
The following EEGLAB extensions allow performing more advanced ERP peak detection:
