The EEGLAB Tutorial is split into four parts. The second part is the
Multiple Subject processing tutorial. In this tutorial, the user is
introduced to more advanced elements of EEGLAB focused around the STUDY
framework used for processing multiple subjects as once. These topics
are recommended for the user to successfully analyse large scale
experiments which go beyond single trials. As of { {REVISIONMONTH} }/{
{REVISIONDAY} }/{ {REVISIONYEAR} }, there are eight topics in the
Multi-subject processing tutorial.
