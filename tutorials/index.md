Welcome to the EEGLAB tutorial
===============================
The tutorial is split into three parts: 

  - the [1st part](/tutorials/single-subject) introduces basic EEGLAB functions and single subject processing
  - the [2nd part]() addresses data analysis at the group level using the EEGLAB STUDY framework
  - the [3rd part]() introduces more advanced elements such as script writing and artifact rejection
  
  You can also refer to the [Online Workshop](/workshops/Online_EEGLAB_Workshop.html) that includes a list of videos presenting EEGALB.
