This section of the tutorial describes how to use the EEGLAB A *STUDY* to manage and process data recorded from multiple subjects,
sessions, and/or conditions of an experimental study. 

EEGLAB uses a *STUDY* for performing statistical comparisons and for clustering of independent
signal components across subjects and sessions. It details the use of the 
set of EEGLAB component clustering functions that allow
exploratory definition and visualization of clusters of equivalent or
similar ICA data components across any number of subjects, subject
groups, experimental conditions, and/or sessions.
