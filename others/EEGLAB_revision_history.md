# EEGLAB revision history

Below are EEGLAB version as they are tagged in the SVN repository. You
may check out each version by selecting the appropriate tag in the
repository. 

The current version (HEAD) should not be different from the
latest tag version. Critical updates are indicated with bug fixes in
<span style= "color:red">red</span>. This correspond to updates where the
processing performed was inaccurate. Updates fixing function crashes
under some particular calling conditions are not indicated in red.

## Why is the zip file for the latest release missing?

The HEAD revision of EEGLAB is usually not available as a .ZIP file. It
is available only using the SVN revision software. About every month, a
revision number is issued and a zip file released.

## Why are you supporting different EEGLAB version?

The HEAD EEGLAB revision (currently version 13) is the revision we are
working on. It contains more bug fixes but is also at times more
unstable (especially new features). We are thus also supporting version 12. In version 12, only important bugs are corrected. All the
development takes place in version 13.

## I do not understand the revision numbers

The first number is the current revision (12 or 13). Following numbers
indicate revision of different level of importance. 

For instance,
version 10.2.3.5 means that we are dealing with EEGLAB 10 and 2 major
revisions were issued, 3 semi-important revisions, and 5 minor
revisions. The second, third and fourth number vary independently. For
instance, if a major revision is made to version 10.2.3.5, the revision
number is going to be 10.3.3.5. 

However, when we change of EEGLAB
version (11 to 12 or 12 to 13), we reset all subsequent sub-revision
numbers (the first version 13 will be 13.0.0.0). The Mathworks uses a
similar scheme for Matlab (for instance 7.11.0.584).

Starting in 2019, we are using the year of the release as the main
revision number. Minor revision are indicated using a second number
2019.0 is version 2019 and first release; 2019.1 is version 2019 and
second release.
