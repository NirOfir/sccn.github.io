## Feedback

Please send detailed questions you cannot find an answer ("How can I ...
?," "Why does ... ?", etc.) to the EEGLAB discussion list (see above) to
give other users the benefit of your Q&A -- but please look for your own
answers by reading the EEGLAB tutorial and/or studying the relevant
function help messages first!

To send (detailed) bug reports, use the [EEGLAB
Github](https://github.com/sccn/eeglab/issues) interface. 

To report
other feedback to the EEGLAB developers directly, email
<eeglab@sccn.ucsd.edu>.
