Eighteenth EEGLAB Workshop
==========================

<font color=blue>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - September 7-10</font>
The 18th EEGLAB Workshop was held from Sunday, September 7th through
Wednesday, September 10th at the Neurology Institute Deolindo Couto of
the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Participants were expected to
bring laptops with Matlab installed so as to be able to participate in
the practical sessions. The workshop introduced and demonstrated the use
of EEGLAB and EEGLAB plug-in tools for performing analysis of EEG and
related data, with detailed method expositions and practical exercises.

**NOTE: The workshop will be fairly technical, some sessions requiring
basic Matlab programming skills. Therefore this workshop might not be
suited for people who are just beginning EEG research with quite limited
knowledge of it. Rather, the intended attendees are those performing EEG
research who want to learn to perform more flexible and in-depth
analysis methods, or who are advanced experts and want to share their
analysis methods with the world in the form of plug-in extensions to the
EEGLAB environment.**

**To access the talk slides, use the links in the Program listing below!
Slides were made available during the workshop.**

[Download EEGLAB](ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/daily/eeglab10_2_2_3b.zip).
Download the latest version of EEGLAB 10.2.2.3b. (needs updating!)

[Download a sample EEG
dataset](ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/julie/EEGLAB_Workshop/faces_data.zip).
Download an example dataset used in the tutorial on independent
component properties.

[Download tutorial scripts](ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/scripts.zip)
Download Matlab scripts and data for the tutorial sessions on writing
scripts dealing with independent component processes.

[Download a single-subject EEGLAB
dataset](ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/julie/EEGLAB_Workshop/Data.zip). This
dataset will be used in the first few Tutorial sessions.

[Download a smaller version of the same EEGLAB
dataset](ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/julie/EEGLAB_Workshop/SmallStern.zip).
This is the same dataset as above but is cut down in size for people who
encounter out-of-memory issues in working with the full dataset.

[Download an EEGLAB STUDY with data from 13
subjects](ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/STUDYstern.zip). This is a VERY large
(2.3GB) file and may even fail to download the first few times you try.
Make sure you have a fast and reliable Internet connection before
attempting this download.

[Download an EEGLAB STUDY with 5 subjects (1.8
GB)](ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/STUDY5subjects.zip). Optional download for
more exploration of EEG studies.

Relevant reading material
-------------------------

EEGLAB graphic interface is built on top of the powerful Matlab
scripting language. Enjoying the full capabilities of EEGLAB for
building macro commands and performing custom and automated processing
requires the ability to manipulate EEGLAB data structures in Matlab.
Because of time constraints, we will NOT provide an introduction to the
Matlab language. Instead users need to familiarize themselves with
Matlab prior to the workshop.

Users of Matlab 7: We recommend running the following demos and reading
the following help sections.

After opening the Matlab desktop, select menu item "Help Demos" and run
the following demos. Note that while the demo is running, you can retype
the text (or copy it) to the main Matlab window:



Mathematics - Basic Matrix Operations

Mathematics - Matrix manipulations

Graphics - 2-D Plots

Programming - Manipulating Multidimentional arrays

Programming - Structures

In the Help Content, read and practice at least the following sections:



Getting Started - Matrices and Arrays - Matrices and Magic squares

Getting Started - Matrices and Arrays - Expressions

Getting Started - Matrices and Arrays - Working with Matrices

Getting Started - Graphics - Basic plotting functions

Getting Started - Programming - Flow Control

Getting Started - Programming - Other data structures

Getting Started - Programming - Scripts and Functions

Each section or demo (if read thoroughly) should take you about 10
minutes, for a total here of about 2 hours. We encourage you to watch
these demos, read these sections, and practice using the skills they
introduce over several days.

If you do not have access to the Matlab demos,
[here](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/matlaboverview.html) is a short
online introduction to Matlab (recommended pages, 1 to 12)

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* A portion of the workshop will be dedicated to writing
EEGLAB scripts -- not being able to understand Matlab syntax will mean
you will miss out on a large portion of the workshop.

*EEGLAB WIKI:* Refer to the [EEGLAB tutorial wiki](/EEGLAB "wikilink")
for additional help.
