Thirty-first EEGLAB Workshop
============================

<font color=blue>Lublin, Poland - HAS BEEN POSTPONED DUE TO COVID-19
</font>
<b> We have carefully considered all possible solutions and decided to
postpone the workshop until 2021. Exact dates for the workshop are being
identified and we will update information as soon as possible. We are
sincerely sorry about the current situation.  
Thank you for your interest in our initiative and your patience at the registration stage. All
registered participants have a guaranteed spot at the workshop in 2021.
We also give you a chance to update or completely re-do your submission.  
All received registration fees will be returned to your account within
two weeks. If you do not receive your payment by that time, please let
us know. </b> 

<b>We sincerely wish you the best health and hope to meet all of you in
Lublin. </b>

The 31st EEGLAB Workshop will take place at [the John Paul II Catholic
University of Lublin](https://www.kul.pl/kul,21.html) in
[Lublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lublin), Poland, about 3 hour by
train from Warsaw. Participants will be expected to bring laptops with
Matlab installed so as to be able to participate in the practical
sessions. The tutorial workshop will introduce and demonstrate the use
of the EEGLAB software environment and EEGLAB-linked tools for
performing advanced analysis of EEG and related data, with detailed
method expositions and practical exercises. There will be a poster
session for participants and an excursion.

The workshop has been under the patronage of the [Polish Neuroscience
Society (PTBUN)](http://www.ptbun.org.pl/?lang=en&a=) and [Advances in
Cognitive Psychology](http://www.ac-psych.org/en/home).

Registration and cost
---------------------

Space at the workshop is limited to about 40 participants. Participants
will be accepted based on their academic background, motivation and
submission for the poster session.

To reimburse travel expenses of Workshop faculty and facilities rental,
costs for the workshop will be as follows:

Registration cost is 300 Euros for students and post-docs, 350 Euros for
faculty and other professional. The registration costs includes
conference space rental, all coffee breaks, and a short excursion.

<b>Registration:</b> <font color="red"> Registration are now closed and
will be reopened in 2021. </font>

<b>Call for papers:</b> During the EEGlab Workshop in Lublin a poster
session will be held. We offer the possibility of publishing abstracts
of presentations in [Advances in Cognitive
Psychology](http://www.ac-psych.org/en/home) – a scientific journal (IF
2018: 1.432) devoted primarily to the study of perception, language
processing, attention, memory, and cognition. The journal’s broad focus
encompasses the behavioral, cognitive, and brain sciences. Additionally,
selected authors may be invited to contribute to special issue of ACP
journal. On the basis of the submitted abstracts, the editor will ask to
prepare manuscripts compliant with the requirements of the journal. If
the manuscript passes the merit assessment by the reviewers, it will be
accepted for publication in a special issue [see
more](http://eeglab2020lublin.com/publication-opportunities/). For more
information, contact Dariusz Zapała at d.zapala@gmail.com .

<b>Warning: </b> This workshop is <em>not</em> aimed for real beginners
in EEG and Matlab - such persons would be wasting much of their time.
Some parts of the workshop are fairly technical. The main topics will be
advanced methods for analyzing EEG and allied behavioral data, methods
including spectral decomposition, independent component analysis,
inverse source analysis, information flow, etc.. Some other parts of the
workshop will require basic Matlab scripting capabilities. Some basic
web resources for learning Matlab are discussed below. Beginners may
also gain experience using Matlab by applying the steps discussed in the
EEGLAB wiki tutorial to the sample dataset which you can freely
download.

Accommodation and travel
------------------------

Participants may fly directly to [Lublin
Airport](https://www.airport.lublin.pl/en/) or may fly to [Warsaw Chopin
Airport](https://www.lotnisko-chopina.pl/en/index.html) and take the [train](https://www.pkp.pl/en/)
or [bus](https://global.flixbus.com/) from
Warsaw to Lublin ([travel
information](http://eeglab2020lublin.com/venue/)).

We do not provide accommodation booking services for participants, but
will offer a discount code for the [Hotel Mercure Lublin
Centrum](https://pl.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274818-d279966-Reviews-Hotel_Mercure_Lublin_Centrum-Lublin_Lublin_Province_Eastern_Poland.html)


MATLAB tutorial
----------------

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* A portion of the workshop will be dedicated to writing EEGLAB scripts -- Not being able
to understand Matlab syntax will mean you will miss out on a large
portion of the workshop.

If you are new to Matlab or need a refresher please consult the material on the [Getting started with Matlab page](/workshops/tutorial_matlab)




MATLAB support
--------------

MathWorks is pleased to provide a special license to workshop
participants to use for the Hands-On Seminar. This is a limited license
for the duration of the workshop and is intended to be used only for
course work and not for government, research, commercial, or other
organization use. The EEGLAB team thanks Vijay Iyer, Neuroscience
Community Liaison at MathWorks for bringing this support from MathWorks
to the workshop.
 <span style="color: red">License information coming soon.</span>



Workshop Program (with corresponding PDFs)
------------------------------------------

<b>Material for the working (including EEGLAB) will be made available on
USB keys during the workshop.</b> Presentation slides will be made
available during the workshop. You only need to bring to the workshop a
laptop with Matlab installed.
