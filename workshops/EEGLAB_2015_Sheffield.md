Twentieth EEGLAB Workshop
=========================

<font color=blue>Sheffield, UK - September 2-5, 2015</font>
![center\|750px\|upright=3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Sheffield_group_pict.jpg)

EEGLAB is an open-source software environment for electrophysiological
signal processing now widely used around the world, with a growing
number of extensions available from many research groups. The 20th
EEGLAB Workshop will be held from Wednesday, September 2nd until
Saturday, September 5th 2015 at the University of Sheffield, UK. The
workshop will consist of tutorials, demonstrations and practical
sessions. It will be led by Scott Makeig, Arnaud Delorme, and John
Iversen of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, UCSD. The
residential course will be limited to 50 delegates; it promises to be a
great opportunity to learn more about advanced EEG analysis and meet
other EEG researchers from the UK and elsewhere. There will also be a
poster session that will provide delegates with the opportunity to
present some of their recent EEG work and to receive feedback from their
colleagues. Registrants will be contacted by the workshop organiser with
further details of the poster session.

Participants are expected to bring laptops with Matlab installed so as
to be able to participate in the practical sessions. The workshop will
introduce and demonstrate the use of EEGLAB and EEGLAB extension tools
for performing analysis of EEG and related data, with detailed method
expositions and practical exercises. There will be an opportunity for
delegates to present some of their EEG work during a poster session.

'''NOTE: The workshop will be fairly technical, some sessions requiring
basic Matlab programming skills. Therefore this workshop might not be
suited for people who are just beginning EEG research with quite limited
knowledge of it, nor for those arriving with no experience at all with
Matlab. Rather, the intended attendees are those performing EEG research
who want to learn to perform more flexible and in-depth analysis methods
using EEGLAB. '''

The EEGLAB workshop will be preceded, on Tuesday 1st September, by a
one-day EEG / LFP conference entitled, "Understanding neural
excitation/inhibition: implications for typical brain function and
clinical disorders." This is a free conference, but if you wish to
attend you must register to attend separately. More information about
this conference is provided
[here](http://eeg-lfp-workshop.reading.ac.uk/index.htm).

The workshop venue is approximately 20 minutes, by taxi, from Sheffield
train station. If travelling from overseas, Manchester airport is
probably the most convenient airport to fly into. There is a direct
train from Manchester airport to Sheffield (\~ 1 hour). The train
journey from London to Sheffield is between 2 and 3 hours, and trains to
Sheffield leave from St Pancras station.

If you have questions, please contact the local organiser Dr Elizabeth
Milne <E.Milne@sheffield.ac.uk>.

Material for download
---------------------

Downloads below are optional. You will receive instructions by email
regarding material for the workshop.

[Material from past workshops are available
here](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/workshop17/materials)

**To access previous versions of the talk slides, use the links in the
Program listing below! New pdf files will be made available during the
workshop.**

First, download the latest version of EEGLAB.

[Download an EEGLAB STUDY with data from 13
subjects](ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/STUDYstern.zip). This is a VERY large
(2.3GB) file and may even fail to download the first few times you try.
Make sure you have a fast and reliable Internet connection before
attempting this download.

[Download an EEGLAB STUDY with 5 subjects (1.8
GB)](ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/STUDY5subjects.zip). Optional download for
more exploration of EEG studies.

Relevant reading material
-------------------------

EEGLAB graphic interface is built on top of the powerful Matlab
scripting language. Enjoying the full capabilities of EEGLAB for
building macro commands and performing custom and automated processing
requires the ability to manipulate EEGLAB data structures in Matlab.
Because of time constraints, we will NOT provide an introduction to the
Matlab language. Instead users need to familiarize themselves with
Matlab prior to the workshop.

Users of Matlab 7: We recommend running the following demos and reading
the following help sections.

After opening the Matlab desktop, select menu item "Help Demos" and run
the following demos. Note that while the demo is running, you can retype
the text (or copy it) to the main Matlab window:



Mathematics - Basic Matrix Operations

Mathematics - Matrix manipulations

Graphics - 2-D Plots

Programming - Manipulating Multidimentional arrays

Programming - Structures

In the Help Content, read and practice at least the following sections:



Getting Started - Matrices and Arrays - Matrices and Magic squares

Getting Started - Matrices and Arrays - Expressions

Getting Started - Matrices and Arrays - Working with Matrices

Getting Started - Graphics - Basic plotting functions

Getting Started - Programming - Flow Control

Getting Started - Programming - Other data structures

Getting Started - Programming - Scripts and Functions

Each section or demo (if read thoroughly) should take you about 10
minutes, for a total here of about 2 hours. We encourage you to watch
these demos, read these sections, and practice using the skills they
introduce over several days.

If you do not have access to the Matlab demos,
[here](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/matlaboverview.html) is a short
online introduction to Matlab (recommended pages, 1 to 12)

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* A portion of the workshop will be dedicated to writing
EEGLAB scripts -- not being able to understand Matlab syntax will mean
you will miss out on some of the workshop.

*EEGLAB WIKI:* Refer to the [EEGLAB tutorial wiki](/EEGLAB "wikilink")
for additional help.
