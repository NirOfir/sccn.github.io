23rd EEGLAB Workshop
====================

<span style="color: blue">Mysuru - January 16-20, 2017</span>
The 23rd EEGLAB Workshop will take place from Monday January 16th
through Friday January 20th in
[Mysuru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore) (formerly Mysore) in the
state of Karnataka, India (about 4 hour train ride from Bangalore
International Airport). The event is organized by the All India
Institute of Speech and Hearing under the sponsorships of a public grant
from the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum. Participants will be
expected to bring laptops with Matlab installed so as to be able to
participate in the practical sessions. The tutorial workshop will
introduce and demonstrate the use of the EEGLAB software environment and
EEGLAB-linked tools for performing advanced analysis of EEG and related
data, with detailed method expositions and practical exercises.

All India Institute of Speech and Hearing, Mysuru
-------------------------------------------------

The [All India Institute of Speech and
Hearing](http://www.aiishmysore.in/) was established in the year 1966 as
an autonomous institute fully funded by the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare, Government of India. The major objectives of the
institute are to impart professional training, render clinical services,
conduct research and educate the public on issues related to
communication disorders such as hearing impairment, mental retardation,
voice, fluency and phonological and language disorders. The institute
offers many courses including Bachelor, Master and Ph.D. courses in the
area of speech-language pathology and audiology. Situated in a lush
green campus of 32 acres adjacent to the University of Mysuru in
Manasagangothri, Mysuru, it is a unique institute in the Asian
sub-continent with its eleven departments and a well equipped Library
and Information Centre. These departments have state-of-the-art
facilities to offer interdisciplinary training to the students. The
institute has been recognized as a Center of Excellence in the area of
Deafness by WHO, as a Centre for Advanced Research by UGC and as a
Science and Technology Institute by DST.

Mysuru
------

Mysuru is the third most populous city in the state of Karnataka, India.
Located at the base of the Chamundi Hills about 146 km (91 miles)
south-west of the state capital Bangalore. Known for its glittering
royal heritage and magnificent monuments and buildings, is also a
thriving centre for the production of premium silk, sandalwood and
incense. The cultural ambience and achievements of Mysuru earned it the
sobriquet *cultural capital of Karnataka.* It has been recently crowned
as the cleanest city in India. Please find different options for

Registration and cost
---------------------

<b>Warning:</b> This workshop is not for true beginners in EEG and
Matlab - such persons would be wasting much of their time since some
parts of the workshop are fairly technical. The main topics will be
advanced methods for analyzing EEG and allied behavioral data, methods
including spectral decomposition, independent component analysis,
inverse source analysis, information flow, etc.. Some other parts of the
workshop will require basic Matlab scripting capabilities. Some basic
web resources for learning Matlab are discussed below.


Poster session
--------------

There will be a poster session that will provide delegates with the
opportunity to present some of their recent EEG work and to receive
feedback from their colleagues. Interested delegates please email
<23eeglabmysuru@gmail.com> 400-600 words abstract of your scientific
posters to the organizers. Further details regarding the posters will be
communicated to interested delegates.

Download the latest version of EEGLAB

Optional download below. Data will be made available on USB keys during
the workshop.

[Download a smaller version of the same EEGLAB
dataset](ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/julie/EEGLAB_Workshop/SmallStern.zip).
This is the same dataset as above but is cut down in size for people who
encounter out-of-memory issues in working with the full dataset.

[Download an EEGLAB STUDY with data from 13
subjects](ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/STUDYstern.zip). This is a VERY large
(2.3GB) file and may even fail to download the first few times you try.
Make sure you have a fast and reliable Internet connection before
attempting this download.

[Download an EEGLAB STUDY with 5 subjects (1.8
GB)](ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/STUDY5subjects.zip). Optional download for
more exploration of EEGLAB studies.

The following files are needed for the Source Information Flow Toolbox
(SIFT) practicum:

Please visit [the SIFT
website](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/SIFT#SIFT_Downloads/) to download all
the available files (SIFT Toolbox, ARFIT toolbox, and Sample Data (143
Mb). We also highly recommend that you download the [SIFT
Handbook/Manual](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/mediawiki/images/d/d2/SIFT_manual_0.1a.pdf)
as we will use this for exercises.
