23rd EEGLAB Workshop
====================

<font color=blue>Mysuru - January 16-20, 2017</font>
The 23rd EEGLAB Workshop will take place from Monday January 16th
through Friday January 20th in
[Mysuru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore) (formerly Mysore) in the
state of Karnataka, India (about 4 hour train ride from Bangalore
International Airport). The event is organized by the All India
Institute of Speech and Hearing under the sponsorships of a public grant
from the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum. Participants will be
expected to bring laptops with Matlab installed so as to be able to
participate in the practical sessions. The tutorial workshop will
introduce and demonstrate the use of the EEGLAB software environment and
EEGLAB-linked tools for performing advanced analysis of EEG and related
data, with detailed method expositions and practical exercises.

All India Institute of Speech and Hearing, Mysuru
-------------------------------------------------

The [All India Institute of Speech and
Hearing](http://www.aiishmysore.in/) was established in the year 1966 as
an autonomous institute fully funded by the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare, Government of India. The major objectives of the
institute are to impart professional training, render clinical services,
conduct research and educate the public on issues related to
communication disorders such as hearing impairment, mental retardation,
voice, fluency and phonological and language disorders. The institute
offers many courses including Bachelor, Master and Ph.D. courses in the
area of speech-language pathology and audiology. Situated in a lush
green campus of 32 acres adjacent to the University of Mysuru in
Manasagangothri, Mysuru, it is a unique institute in the Asian
sub-continent with its eleven departments and a well equipped Library
and Information Centre. These departments have state-of-the-art
facilities to offer interdisciplinary training to the students. The
institute has been recognized as a Center of Excellence in the area of
Deafness by WHO, as a Centre for Advanced Research by UGC and as a
Science and Technology Institute by DST.

Mysuru
------

Mysuru is the third most populous city in the state of Karnataka, India.
Located at the base of the Chamundi Hills about 146 km (91 miles)
south-west of the state capital Bangalore. Known for its glittering
royal heritage and magnificent monuments and buildings, is also a
thriving centre for the production of premium silk, sandalwood and
incense. The cultural ambience and achievements of Mysuru earned it the
sobriquet *cultural capital of Karnataka.* It has been recently crowned
as the cleanest city in India. Please find different options for
reaching Mysuru

Registration and cost
---------------------

<b>Warning:</b> This workshop is not for true beginners in EEG and
Matlab - such persons would be wasting much of their time since some
parts of the workshop are fairly technical. The main topics will be
advanced methods for analyzing EEG and allied behavioral data, methods
including spectral decomposition, independent component analysis,
inverse source analysis, information flow, etc.. Some other parts of the
workshop will require basic Matlab scripting capabilities. Some basic
web resources for learning Matlab are discussed below.

<b>Registration:</b>

Space at the workshop is limited to 50 delegates. Registration cost is
INR 4000 for Ph.D. students and INR 6000 for postdoctoral fellows and
others from India. For foreign Ph.D. students and others, registration
cost is USD 200 and USD 300 respectively. Registration cost will include

as we will use this for exercises.

Relevant reading material
-------------------------

The EEGLAB graphic interface is built using the powerful Matlab
scripting language. Enjoying the full capabilities of EEGLAB for
building, testing, and running scripts and functions and performing
custom and automated processing requires basic knowledge of how to
manipulate EEGLAB data structures in Matlab. Because of time
constraints, we will NOT provide an introduction to Matlab scripting.
Instead, attendees must familiarize themselves with Matlab <b>before</b>
coming to the workshop.

New users of Matlab: We recommend running the following demos and
reading these help sections:

After opening the Matlab desktop, select menu item "Help Demos" and run
the following demos. Note that while a demo is running, you can retype
the text (or copy it) to the main Matlab window:



Mathematics - Basic Matrix Operations

Mathematics - Matrix manipulations

Graphics - 2-D Plots

Programming - Manipulating Multidimentional arrays

Programming - Structures

In the Help Content, read and practice at least the following sections:



Getting Started - Matrices and Arrays - Matrices and Magic squares

Getting Started - Matrices and Arrays - Expressions

Getting Started - Matrices and Arrays - Working with Matrices

Getting Started - Graphics - Basic plotting functions

Getting Started - Programming - Flow Control

Getting Started - Programming - Other data structures

Getting Started - Programming - Scripts and Functions

Each section or demo (if read thoroughly) should take you about 10
minutes, for a total here of about 2 hours. If you do not use Matlab
regularly, we encourage you to watch these demos, read these sections,
and practice using the skills they introduce over several days.

If you do not have access to the Matlab demos,
[here](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/matlaboverview.html) is a short
online introduction to Matlab (recommended pages, 1 to 12)

<font color="dark blue">*IMPORTANT NOTE:*</font> A portion of the
workshop will be dedicated to writing EEGLAB scripts -- Not being able
to understand Matlab syntax will mean you will miss out on a large
portion of the workshop.

*EEGLAB WIKI:* Refer to the [EEGLAB tutorial wiki](/EEGLAB "wikilink")
for additional help.
