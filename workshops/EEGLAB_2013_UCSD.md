The 17th EEGLAB Workshop drew 104 attendees from as far away as New
Zealand, Korea, and England. The two-track format was successful;
workshop lectures on advanced toolboxes were attended by 10-25, while
60-70 attended the basic EEGLAB introduction. This photo was taken the
last morning.

San Diego and UCSD
------------------

Although less than 60 years old, the [University of California San
Diego](http://ucsd.edu/), sister to UCLA, UC Berkeley, and seven other
UC schools, is now an American research powerhouse. Located by the
spectacular cliffs and beaches of La Jolla, UCSD enjoys near year-round
temperate weather.

Three-track program
-------------------

For the first time, this workshop featured a Three-track design. Each
morning and afternoon, lectures to the whole group were interspersed
with sessions in three tracks. Attendees new to EEGLAB could choose the
basic EEGLAB instruction track. Attendees who were already familiar with
EEGLAB could join work sessions on newer, more advanced EEGLAB toolboxes
and related software.
