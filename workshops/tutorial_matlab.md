# Getting started with Matlab 

The EEGLAB graphic interface is built on top of the powerful Matlab
scripting language. Enjoying the full capabilities of EEGLAB for
building macro commands and performing custom and automated processing
requires the ability to manipulate EEGLAB data structures in Matlab.

Because of time constraints, we will NOT provide an introduction to the
Matlab language. Instead users need to familiarize themselves with
Matlab prior to the workshop. 

## Matlab Online Course

MathWorks proposes some Matlab self-paced online courses. We advise that
 you complete the "Matlab Onramp", a 1-2hour interactive introduction to the
  basics of Matlab programming. 
  
Accessing Matlab Onramp: 
- follow [this link to Matlab Academy](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/). 
- or from within Matlab, select the "Learn Matlab" menu 

Note that you will be asked to log in into your MathWorks
 account, which can be created for free [here](https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/register). 


## Matlab Documentation
Alternatively you can also consult Matlab's help and documentation. 
We recommend running the following demos and reading the following help sections:

In the Matlab help, you should perform the first 3 tutorials 

-   Getting Started with MATLAB
-   Language Fundamentals
-   Mathematics
-   Graphics (first section 2-D plot only)

Each section or demo (if read thoroughly) should take you about 40
minutes, for a total here of about 2 hours. We encourage you to read
these sections over several days.


<!-- If you do not have access to the Matlab demos, [here](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/matlaboverview.html) is a short online introduction to Matlab (recommended pages, 1 to 12).
-->
If you do not use Matlab regularly, we encourage you to watch these demos, read these sections, and practice using the skills they introduce over several days.
