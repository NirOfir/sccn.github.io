## Message to EEGLAB users related to the last release of MATLAB

Dear Users, At this moment we are working to make EEGLAB fully
compatible with the last release of MATLAB (R2014b). Since a lot of
changes have been made on the MATLAB graphic system, some EEGLAB
functionalities are not working under this new distribution. We truly
apologize for this inconvenience that is completely out of our hands. We
will be delivering a new release as soon as we fix all the issues.
Sincerely, The EEGLAB team.

PS. If more information is needed, you can reach us trough the EEGLAB's
discussion list.
