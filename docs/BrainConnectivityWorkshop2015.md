"MS Mincho";mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'> The neuroscience
community is sensitive to the considerable gap that exists between
theoretical neuroscience at different levels (e.g.,
subcellular/molecular processes, neuronal networks, and larger-scale
system neuroscience) and applied neuroscience; the latter explored
mostly using neurophysiological techniques and neuroimaging. A number of
contradictory or disconnected experimental results observed using
diverse techniques have motivated the development of both sophisticated
systems to perform multimodal simultaneous recordings at different brain
scales as well as unified theoretical models to explain the
physiological mechanisms linking these scales. Human brain imaging data
is by necessity mostly non-invasively recorded and therefore represents
brain dynamics on larger scales; its robust interpretation therefore
requires such a unified foundation. Every year, the Brain Connectivity
Workshop (BCW) draws together experimentalists and theoreticians from
various disciplines to find feasible ways to fill this gap by combining
computational neuroscience, neurophysiology and neuroimaging.</span>

International Workshop on Brain Connectivity will be held in La Jolla,
California, June 10 â€“ 12, 2015. This edition of the workshop will take
place at a climactic moment in the history of neuroscience, when several
major global scientific efforts have begun to converge:</span>

  - \<span

"MS Mincho";mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'\>The Human Brain
Project (https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/) proposed by the European
community to build a novel infrastructure of information computing
technology for brain research</span>

  - \<span

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho";mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'\>The BRAIN
initiative (http://www.whitehouse.gov/share/brain-initiative) and the
Human Connectome Project (http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/) by the
US government to recruit national resources to revolutionize our
understanding of the human mind and brain, and to uncover new ways to
treat, prevent, nd cure brain disorders</span>

"MS Mincho";mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The La Jolla edition
of the BCW will focus on the role of electrophysiology in understanding
the fine temporal scale of brain network dynamics as well as the
mechanisms by mean of which emergent dynamics, behavior, and human
experience originate from multi-scale interactions. In light of
limitations in temporal resolution encountered using other functional
neuroimaging modalities, this topic is crucial for the advancement of
the global efforts. The first day will be dedicated to Educational
lectures by, followed by the two-day workshop in which short
presentations will stimulate longer general discussions among the
faculty and 100 attendees.</span>
